# MotionBlurJS
## What is MotionBlurJS
**MotionBlurJS** is a lightweight JavaScript library that allows your animations to shine with homemade native CSS Motion Blur and Motion Fade while keeping your code clean and your CSS animations smooth.

## The simple method
You can use *MotionBlurJS* by simply linking to it in your document head tag like so:
```HTML
<head>
    <script src="https://www.motionblurjs.com/blur.js"></script>
</head>
```
After that, all you have to do is naming the class of the div you want to blur to either the **blurjs** or **fadejs** class, you can mix it with your current classes as well by separating those with spaces, like so:
```HTML
<div id="yourId" class="someClass blurjs"></div>
```
or
```HTML
<div id="yourId" class="fadejs someClass"></div> 
```
## The dynamic method
The dynamic method requires the same script linking as the simple method shown above.<br/>
This method will allow you to dynamically blur the objects even if they wonâ€™t load with the page itself, to achieve this just add this img tag inside the div you want to blur, like so:
```HTML
<div id="yourId" class="someClass">
    <img src="" onerror="blurMe(event);" style="display:none !important;" />
</div>
```
or
```HTML
<div id="yourId" class="someClass">
    <img src="" onerror="fadeMe(event);" style="display:none !important;" />
</div>
```
## The SVG method
This method can add motion blur to SVG elements and .SVG files, by simply linking to it first thing inside the svg tag, like so:
```HTML
<svg ...>
    <script xlink:href="https://www.motionblurjs.com/blurSVG.js" />
```
After that, all you have to do is naming the class of the element you want to blur to either the **blurjs** or **fadejs** class, you can mix it with your current classes as well by separating those with spaces, like so: 
```HTML
<circle id="yourId" class="st0 blurjs" cx="200" cy="200" r="42" />
```
or
```HTML
<circle id="yourId" class="st0 blurjs" cx="200" cy="200" r="42" />
```
## How does it work
**MotionBlurJS** will duplicate your objects so they can get blurred or faded on runtime, the DOM will only show the necessary objects (no pesky img tags) in order for it to work properly the blurred object has to be positioned absolutely and to be animated with CSS animation.
